    <h1 class="fade-in">Lessons from Past eCTF Competitions</h1>
    <p class="fade-in">Explore strategies and insights shared by teams and industry experts. Learn from past challenges to build a robust attack and defense strategy.</p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Reverse Engineering Bootloaders</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
      Many teams begin by reverse-engineering firmware bootloaders to discover vulnerabilities. In one instance, a team uncovered weaknesses in the bootloader routine that allowed them to bypass security checks entirely.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Token Generation &amp; Bypass Techniques</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
      Effective token generation is key. Some teams exploited common errors in token validation to perform replay attacks or bypass authentication entirely. Studying these methods can help you avoid similar pitfalls.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Memory Exploits & Buffer Overflows</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
      Real-world vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows have been exploited to create ROP chains. Learn about these techniques and how proper memory safety can mitigate such risks.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Hardware Interfaces (JTAG, UART, etc.)</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
      Physical interfaces like UART and JTAG can reveal sensitive information if left unsecured. Case studies from previous eCTF events show how attackers used these interfaces to extract encryption keys and control flows.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in">Team Strategies & Community Insights</h2>
    <ul class="fade-in">
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Top teams often provide detailed write-ups after the competition. These documents reveal both successful strategies and lessons learned from failed attempts.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-Team Sharing:</strong> Information posted on Reddit or LinkedIn by participants has helped new teams refine their approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Tool Usage:</strong> Leveraging open-source tools like Ghidra, OpenOCD, and custom Python scripts can give your team a competitive edge.</li>
    </ul>
