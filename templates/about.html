    <h1>About This Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the MITRE eCTF Dashboard — a capstone project crafted for ETSU Cyber Bucs!</p>
    <p><strong>What is the MITRE eCTF?</strong><br>
      The Embedded Capture the Flag (eCTF) is an annual cybersecurity competition hosted by MITRE that challenges teams to design secure systems and then exploit vulnerabilities in each other’s devices. This unique format combines both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills on real embedded systems.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What does this dashboard offer?</strong><br>
      - An interactive timeline of key events for the 2024 and 2025 MITRE eCTF competitions.<br>
      - A comprehensive learning module with reverse engineering challenges, tips, and resources.<br>
      - A toolkit featuring a UART simulator and encoding/decoding playground to help you prepare for the attack phase.<br>
      - Additional downloadable resources and guides.
    </p>
    <p>This platform is designed especially for ETSU students to support our journey in the MITRE eCTF. Go Bucs!</p>
